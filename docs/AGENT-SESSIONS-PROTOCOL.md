# Agent sessions, planning, subagents and suggestions: worker protocol (v1, 2026-09-17)

Contract between the GUI (`src/main.cpp`) and the per-pane worker (`backend/worker.py`).
Additive to the existing protocol (route, configure, ask, cancel, queue_*, reset, presets,
store_key, import_warp, keybindings). All messages are one JSON object per line.
Unknown fields are ignored. Errors use the existing `error` event.

Owner decisions this implements are recorded in
`issues/features/2026-09-17-agent-sessions-planning-subagents.md`.

## 1. Configure additions

`configure` accepts, all optional:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `preset` | string | already exists; used to look up defaults below |
| `context_window` | int tokens | model window; GUI sends the preset value; backend falls back to its preset table |
| `effort` | `low\|medium\|high\|max` | reasoning effort, mapped per provider (section 3) |
| `compact_threshold` | float 0.5–0.98 | auto-compact when used/window reaches this; default 0.90 unless research changes it |
| `session_dir` | abs path | where sessions and checkpoints are stored (default `~/.local/share/relay/sessions/<workspace-hash>/`) |
| `plans_dir` | abs path | default `<workspace>/.relay/plans` |
| `instructions` | `{"files": [abs paths], "project_auto": true}` | instruction files to load; `project_auto` also loads project files found in the workspace (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, WARP.md, ... per the scan table) |
| `agents` | `{"dirs": [abs paths] or omitted}` | agent definition directories; omitted = all known locations (section 7) |

`configured` event gains: `context_window`, `effort`, `mode`, `instructions` (list of loaded paths), `agents` (count), `session_id`.

## 2. Model and effort without losing the conversation

- `set_model {preset, base_url, model, extra, max_tokens, context_window, use_stored_key, api_key?}` → swaps the provider between turns (refused while a turn runs: error with `agent_busy`). Event `model_changed {model, preset, context_window}`.
- `set_effort {effort}` → event `effort_changed {effort, applied: {...provider params}}`.

## 3. Effort mapping

| Relay effort | Kimi K3 | GLM-5.3 (Z.AI) | OpenRouter DeepSeek |
|---|---|---|---|
| low | `reasoning_effort: low` | `thinking: enabled`, `reasoning_effort: low` | `reasoning: {effort: low}` |
| medium | `high` | `high` | `medium` |
| high | `high` | `high` | `high` |
| max | `max` | `max` | `high` (or `xhigh` if supported) |

Verify against provider docs before shipping; keep the table in `backend/relay_core/presets.py`.

## 4. Context and compaction

- After every model response the worker emits `context {used_tokens, window, percent, threshold, estimated: bool}` (provider `usage` when present, else an estimate).
- `context` message → same event on demand.
- Auto-compaction when `percent >= threshold` at a step boundary (never between a tool call and its results): emits `compaction_started {reason: "auto"|"manual"}` then `compacted {before_tokens, after_tokens, summary_chars}`. Order: drop/trim old tool outputs first, then summarize older turns with a no-tools model call, keeping the system prompt, instructions, the last N turns and the current task.
- `compact {focus?: string}` → manual compaction.

## 5. Checkpoints, rewind, fork, sessions, recaps

- A checkpoint is recorded at the start of each user turn: `{turn, prompt_preview, time, message_index}`. Before any agent file write, the file's previous bytes (or "absent") are saved under the session's checkpoint store, keyed by turn.
- `checkpoints` → `checkpoints {items: [{turn, prompt_preview, time, files: [paths]}]}`.
- `rewind {turn, restore: "conversation"|"files"|"both"}` → restores; files changed since (hash mismatch) are skipped and reported. Event `rewound {turn, restored_files: [...], conflicts: [...], note}`. Shell side effects are never undone; the note says so.
- `fork {turn?}` → `fork_state {state}` where `state` is an opaque JSON object (messages up to `turn`, model, effort, mode, instructions). GUI starts a new pane and sends `load_state {state}` → `state_loaded {session_id, turns}`.
- Sessions auto-save after every turn to `session_dir/<session_id>.json` (title = first prompt preview, updated time, model, turns).
- `sessions` → `sessions {items: [{id, title, updated, turns, model}]}`; `resume {id}` → `state_loaded`, followed by a `recap {text}` event.
- **Recap (owner: "claude style recaps", the session-return kind):** when a session is resumed, or when the pane's window regains focus after the agent finished work while the user was away (GUI sends `recap_request`), the worker produces a short summary of what happened (goal, what was done, current state, next step) with a no-tools model call and emits `recap {text, turns_covered}`.

## 6. Plan mode (Warp-style)

- `set_mode {mode: "build"|"plan"}` → `mode_changed {mode}`.
- Plan mode: run_command, read_file, list_directory, load_skill, read_skill_file stay available for investigation; write_file and set_keybinding are removed from the tool list; the system prompt says to investigate without changing anything and to finish by calling `write_plan`.
- Tool `write_plan {title, content}` (plan mode only) writes `plans_dir/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>-<slug>.md` and emits `plan_written {path, title}`. The GUI opens it in an editable pane.
- The GUI executes a plan by sending `set_mode build` then `ask` with text referencing the plan path; "execute in fresh context" sends `reset` first.

## 7. Instructions and agent definitions

- `scan_instructions {workspace}` → `instructions_found {items: [{path, tool, scope: "global"|"project", bytes, exists}]}` covering the conventions table in `docs/INTAKE-CLARIFICATION-RESEARCH.md`.
- `synthesize_instructions {files: [...], target}` → runs a no-tools model call that merges the files into one relay.md and writes `target` (default `~/.config/relay/relay.md`) → `instructions_synthesized {path, bytes}`.
- Loaded instructions go into the system prompt, each labelled with its path, lower priority than the user's request, with a size cap.
- Agent definitions load from every known location by default: `.relay/agents`, `~/.config/relay/agents`, `.claude/agents`, `~/.claude/agents`, opencode's `.opencode/agent(s)` and `~/.config/opencode/agent(s)`, plus any others in the research table. Later sources do not override earlier ones with the same name; duplicates are reported.
- `agents_list` → `agents {items: [{name, description, source, model, tools}]}`.

## 8. Subagents

- Main-agent tool `agent {description, prompt, subagent_type, background: bool, model?, effort?}`; `agent_message {id, text}`; `agent_wait {id?}`. Several `agent` calls in one response run concurrently (max 4). Subagents cannot spawn subagents.
- Events: `subagent_started {id, type, description, background, model}`, `subagent_progress {id, status: "running"|"waiting"|"done"|"failed"|"stopped", tools, tokens, elapsed_ms, last_activity}`, `subagent_finished {id, outcome, summary}`.
- `agent_subscribe {id, on: bool}` → while on, the worker also sends `subagent_event {id, event: {...}}` wrapping that subagent's delta/tool_started/tool_output/tool_result events.
- `agent_message {id, text}` (user → subagent), `agent_stop {id | "all"}`.
- Background completion: the result is delivered to the main agent before its next model call; if the main agent is idle, the worker enqueues a main turn "Background agent <id> finished: <summary>" (owner decision 4).

## 9. Suggestions

- `suggest {kind: "next_command", command, exit_status, cwd, output_tail?}` → `suggestion {kind, id, text, reason}` (AI-suggested next shell command; opt-in setting, off by default in the GUI).
- `suggest {kind: "next_prompt"}` after an agent turn → `suggestion {kind: "next_prompt", text}` (Claude-style prompt suggestion).
- Ghost-text history autosuggestions are GUI-only (no worker call).

## 10. Attachments

`ask` accepts `attachments: [{path}]` (from `@file` in the composer). The worker reads each (text, capped, inside or outside the workspace if the user picked it) and prepends a labelled block to that user turn.

## 11. Routing assist, thinking, tool outputs, skills (v1.1, 2026-09-17)

Owner decisions: model-assisted routing is allowed; thinking and tool calls must be easy to
observe; skills can be refined and imported with review. Scratchpad design is pending research.

**Routing assist.** `route` results gain `needs_assist: bool` (local rules could not decide:
command-like English words such as go, install, make, find, open, test, build, start, time, plus
sentence signals) and `assist_reason`. The GUI then sends `route_assist {id, text, cwd, mode}` →
`route_assisted {id, route: "shell"|"agent", confidence: 0..1, reason, elapsed_ms}` using the
pane's configured model with no tools, low effort and a tiny max_tokens; errors or a 2 s timeout
return `route_assisted {id, route: null, error}`. The GUI must never block typing on it.

**Thinking.** The worker streams reasoning as `thinking_delta {turn_id, text}` (from provider
reasoning fields) and ends with `thinking_done {turn_id, elapsed_ms, chars}`. `delta` stays
answer text only.

**Turn and tool summaries.** Each agent turn has a `turn_id` included in `agent_started`,
`tool_started`, `tool_result` and `done`. At turn end the worker emits
`turn_summary {turn_id, elapsed_ms, thinking_ms, tools: [{call_id, name, preview, ok, exit_code?}]}`.
`tool_output_get {turn_id, call_id}` → `tool_output {turn_id, call_id, name, preview, result}`
(the worker keeps results for the last 50 turns). `turn_transcript_get {turn_id}` →
`turn_transcript {turn_id, items: [...]}` in the same shape as `subagent_transcript`.

**Skills.** `skills_list` → `skills {items: [{name, description, path, source, excluded, refined_from?}]}`.
`refine_skills {names: [...], target_dir?}` (default `~/.config/relay/skills`) writes refined copies
without touching originals → `skills_refined {items: [{name, path, from}]}`.
`import_skills_preview {url, ref?}` clones into a temporary dir and pins the commit →
`skills_import_preview {url, commit, items: [{name, description, path, files}]}`;
`import_skills_confirm {url, commit, names}` copies the chosen skills to
`~/.local/share/relay/skill-imports/<repo>@<commit>/` and enables them → `skills_imported {items}`.
No automatic updates; `skills_check_updates {url}` → `skills_updates {url, current, latest}`.
